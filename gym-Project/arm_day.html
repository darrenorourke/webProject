TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MAXIMUM ARM SIZE GAINS

arm exercises

It is not enough to perform the exercises listed above, you have to constantly push yourself, shooting for higher volume, increased sets, and amplified intensity. Doing the same exercises with no change results in a plateau, where size or strength stop showing up.
•Try to increase the weight you are using every workout by 1 to 5 pounds. At the same time, make sure you are able to maintain near-perfect form.
•Decrease your rest breaks between sets on your higher volume end sets. This will force your body to become more efficient at utilizing fuel sources while increasing your endurance capacity.
•Incorporate failure sets into your workout. It is recommended to save a failure set for the last set of an exercise. Simply do as many repa as you possibly can with good form.
•Make sure you mix up your workout after 6 to 10 weeks, utilizing the other exercises, higher volume, or increased sets.
•Be sure to focus on the muscle you are working. Review the anatomy section to understand the workings of that muscle to help you visualize the stress being placed upon it. This mind to muscle connection will help increase tension and hypertrophy.

Bonus Tip: Nothing feels better on arm day than a solid muscle pump. Check out our pre-workout supplement called ALTIUS which has clinically effective doses of Citrulline Malate and Betaine.
